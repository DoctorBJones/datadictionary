Description: Creates a data dictionary from any dataset. It includes overall 
    summaries of rows and columns and at-a-glance summaries of each variable 
    including mean, median, min and max for numeric variables, counts in each
    level for factors, and the number of responses and missing for character 
    variables. You can nominate one or more id variables, for example individuals 
    and clusters, so you don't get nonsense data summaries for these variables. 
    You can also include a vector to add labels if you want descriptions included 
    in the document. You can opt for the output to write directly to Excel.
